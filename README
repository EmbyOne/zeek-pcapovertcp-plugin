# Zeek::PcapOverTcp

This plugin provides native PcapOverTcp support for Zeek. For details about PcapOverTcp, see the corresponding [Netresec URL](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2022-08&post=What-is-PCAP-over-IP)

## Installation


### Package Manager

The plugin is available as package for the [Zeek Package Manager](https://github.com/zeek/package-manager) and can be installed using the following command:

    zkg install zeek-pcapovertcp-plugin

### Manual Install

The following will compile and install the PcapOverTcp plugin alongside Zeek:

    # ./configure && make && make install

If everything built and installed correctly, you should see this:

    # zeek -NN Zeek::PcapOverTcp
    Zeek::PcapOverTcp - Packet acquisition via PcapOverTcp (dynamic, version 1.0.0)
    [Packet Source] PcapOverTcpReader (interface prefix "pcapovertcp"; supports live input)
    [Constant] PcapOverTcp::buffer_size

## Usage

Once installed, you can use PcapOverTcp interfaces/ports by prefixing them with `pcapovertcp::` on the command line. For example, to use PcapOverTcp to use a local socket with port 57012:

    # zeek -i pcapovertcp::127.0.0.1:57012

## Usage with `zeekctl`

To use the PcapOverTcp plugin with `zeekctl`, the `custom` load balance method can be utilized. The following shows an exemplary configuration:

    [manager]
    type=manager
    host=localhost
     
    [proxy-1]
    type=proxy
    host=localhost
     
    [worker-1]
    type=worker
    host=localhost
    interface=pcapovertcp::1.2.3.4:57012
    # Optional parameters for per node configuration:
    pcapovertcp_buffer_size=128*1024*1024

    [worker-2]
    type=worker
    host=localhost
    interface=pcapovertcp::1.2.3.5:57012
    # Optional parameters for per node configuration:
    pcapovertcp_buffer_size=128*1024*1024

Note that the PcapOverTcp plugin does not yet support multiple workers consuming the same stream.

## Debugging the Plugin

To debug the plugin, configure with --enable-debug, as well as Zeek itself.  Then when you run Zeek, add '-B plugin-Zeek-PcapOverTcp'

## Advanced Configuration

While the plugin aims at providing a "plug and play" user experience, it exposes at the momement one option of the underlying API for customization (see [init.zeek](scripts/init.zeek) for the default values):

* `buffer_size`: Set the overall buffer size allocated per socket. 

## Limitations
